# Ratio UI ðŸ§±

A design system built on clarity, proportion, and composable components.

## About Ratio UI

The word **"Ratio"** comes from Latin, where it carries rich and layered meanings such as:

The name **Ratio** is inspired by the Latin word for _reason_, _measure_, and _relationship_. It reflects our focus on clarity, composability, and visual harmony â€” the foundations of a resilient and elegant design system.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @eventuras/ratio-ui
```

### Peer Dependencies

Ratio UI requires the following peer dependencies to be installed in your project:

```bash
pnpm add react react-dom react-aria-components react-stately @react-aria/overlays clsx lucide-react @tabler/icons-react
```

**Why external dependencies?**  
To reduce bundle size and avoid duplication, Ratio UI externalizes common UI dependencies. This means you control the versions and ensure consistency across your application.

## Roadmap

The intention of Ratio UI is to be a design system that handles most of the UI components needed for the Eventuras knowledge ecosystem. We will not have any business logic in this library.

## Getting Started

Be sure to be in the 'libs/ratio-ui' directory. Start the development server: `npm run dev`, and open your browser to `http://localhost:6006`.
