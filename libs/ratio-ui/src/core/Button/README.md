# Button

This Button component is a lightweight, animated React element designed for maximum flexibility and accessibility. It offers five visual styles—Primary, Secondary, Outline, Light and Text—each with smooth transitions, hover shadows and press‐scale effects. Built with Tailwind CSS utility classes and Lucide icons, it gracefully handles loading states, full‐width layouts and icon‐only buttons, all while ensuring proper focus and aria labeling for screen readers.

Under the hood, it accepts both native button attributes and a simple set of props: variant to choose style, loading to show a spinner, icon to prepend any React node, onDark to invert text color on dark backgrounds, and block to stretch full width. Additional spacing can be applied via margin and padding props (BoxProps), making it trivial to align within any design system.
