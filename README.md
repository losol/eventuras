## 📦 Release Process

Eventuras uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and automated deployments.

### Creating a Release

**In feature branches:**
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Create a changeset describing your changes
pnpm changeset

# 3. Commit and create PR
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature"
git push
```

**After PR is merged to main:**
```bash
# 1. Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull

# 2. Run the release command (this does everything automatically)
pnpm release
```

The `pnpm release` command will:
- ✅ Bump package versions based on accumulated changesets
- ✅ Update CHANGELOGs
- ✅ Commit version changes
- ✅ Create git tags
- ✅ Push to GitHub
- ✅ Trigger automated deployments

### Automated Deployments

- `@eventuras/api@*` tags → Deploy API to Azure
- `@eventuras/web@*` tags → Deploy web app to Vercel (prod-1 and prod-2)

**Note:** The packages `@eventuras/api`, `@eventuras/web`, and `@eventuras/event-sdk` have linked versions — they always bump together to the same version number.
