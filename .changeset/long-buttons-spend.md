Add Timeline collection for chronological event management

Implements a new Timeline collection (slug: `timelines`) for managing historical events with:

- Flexible date precision (exact to century level, with circa support)
- Event relationships (caused_by, led_to, part_of, concurrent_with)
- Full versioning support for scholarly updates
- Multi-tenant organization isolation
- SEO optimization with schema.org Event markup

Localized as "timelines" (English) / "tidslinjer" (Norwegian).

See ADR 0008 for architectural decisions and rationale.
