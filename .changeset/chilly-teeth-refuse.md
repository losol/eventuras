Add API key authentication support for programmatic access to Media and Notes collections.

**Documentation:**
- ADR 0011: API Keys for Media and Notes - architecture decision and rationale
- Administrator guide with setup instructions and code examples

This enables external services and automation scripts to authenticate with Historia's REST API using stable, non-expiring credentials while maintaining strict access control.
