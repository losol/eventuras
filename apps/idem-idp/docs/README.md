# Idem — Identity & Access Platform

This directory contains the canonical documentation for **Idem**,
an OpenID Connect Provider with support for IdP brokering,
administrative configuration, and strict environment isolation.

The documentation consists of:

- Architecture overview
- Canonical database model (TXT)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- A concrete development plan

ADRs are used to document *why* decisions were made, not just *what*.
