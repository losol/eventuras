# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Administrator Guide

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-17
**Version:** Historia CMS v3.x (Payload CMS 3.69+)
**Architecture Decision:** See [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-site-editor-role.md)

## Overview

Historia uses a **role-based access control (RBAC)** system to manage what users can do on different websites (tenants). Each user can have different roles on different websites, allowing fine-grained control over permissions.

### Role Types

**Global Roles** (apply across all websites):
- `system-admin` — Full system access (the only global role)

**Site Roles** (apply per website/tenant):
- `admin` — Full control of the website
- `editor` — Content creation and editing
- `commerce` — Product and order management
- `member` — Read-only access

**Important:** As of v3.x, only `system-admin` exists as a global role. All other access must be granted through site-specific roles assigned per website.

## Assigning Roles to Users

### In Payload Admin UI

1. Navigate to **Users** collection
2. Select a user to edit
3. Scroll to **Tenants** field (in sidebar)
4. Click **Add Tenant**
5. Select the **Website/Tenant**
6. Select one or more **Site Roles**:
   - `admin` — Full control
   - `editor` — Content editing
   - `commerce` — E-commerce
   - `member` — Read-only
7. Click **Save**

### Multiple Roles

Users can have **multiple roles on the same website**:
- ✅ **Editor + Commerce** — Can write content AND manage products
- ✅ **Editor + Member** — Member is redundant (editor includes member permissions)
- ✅ **Admin + Editor** — Admin includes all permissions, so editor is redundant

**Permissions are additive** — users get the union of all role permissions.

### Different Roles on Different Sites

Example user configuration:
```
Sarah Johnson
  Website A → Admin (full control)
  Website B → Editor + Commerce (content + products)
  Website C → Member (read-only)
```

## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Blog with Multiple Writers
**Setup:**
- Website: `company-blog.com`
- User A: `editor` (writes articles)
- User B: `editor` (writes articles)
- User C: `admin` (manages, publishes, deletes)

**Result:** Writers can create and edit articles, but only admin can delete or publish.

---

### Scenario 2: E-commerce Store with Content Team
**Setup:**
- Website: `online-store.com`
- User A: `editor` (writes product descriptions and blog posts)
- User B: `commerce` (manages products and orders)
- User C: `editor` + `commerce` (content + store management)
- User D: `admin` (full control)

**Result:** Clear separation between content and commerce, with option to combine roles.

---

### Scenario 3: Multi-Site Agency
**Setup:**
- User (Agency Manager):
  - `client-a.com` → `admin`
  - `client-b.com` → `admin`
  - `client-c.com` → `admin`
- User (Freelance Writer):
  - `client-a.com` → `editor`
  - `client-b.com` → `editor`
- User (Client):
  - `client-a.com` → `member` (preview access)

**Result:** Agency manager controls all sites, writer edits for two, client previews own site.

## Troubleshooting

### "User cannot see website in admin UI"
**Cause:** User is not assigned to the website's tenants.
**Solution:** Add user to website in **Tenants** field with appropriate role.

---

### "Editor cannot delete content"
**Cause:** Only admins and global admins can delete.
**Solution:** This is by design. Assign `admin` role if deletion is required.

---

### "User can see drafts from other websites"
**Cause:** User may have global `admin` role.
**Solution:** This is expected for global admins. Site-specific roles are scoped to their websites.

---

### "Commerce user cannot edit articles"
**Cause:** Commerce role is for products/orders, not content.
**Solution:** Assign both `commerce` and `editor` roles if user needs both permissions.

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only assign roles users actually need
2. **Regular Audits:** Review user roles quarterly
3. **Separate Concerns:** Use `editor` and `commerce` roles separately unless user truly needs both
4. **Admin Sparingly:** Only assign `admin` to trusted website managers
5. **Global Admin Rarely:** `system-admin` and global `admin` should be very limited
