# Contributing to Eventuras

Eventuras is an open source project for managing events and registrations. We welcome contributions from anyone who wants to improve the project. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting started

If you donÂ´t have write access to the repo, you will need to fork the project and clone it to your local machine. If you have write access, you can clone the project directly.

## Committing your changes

When you commit your changes, you need to:

-   Use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention to indicate the type and scope of your changes, such as `feat: add new feature` or `fix: correct bug`. The allowed types are: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test.
-   Include a reference to the issue or pull request that your commit addresses, if applicable, such as `closes #123` or `refs #456`.
-   Squash your commits if you have multiple commits for the same change.

## Commit at least daily

We like to merge often to master to keep the project up-to-date and avoid conflicts. For partner developers we do like daily commits to the working branch. This way we can keep track of the progress, and correct early if needed.

-   Keep your branch in sync with the main branch by regularly pulling the latest changes from main branch.
-   Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase process.

## Create a pull request

We do like pull requests to main branch, also in draft status. Therefore, you need to:

-   Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.
-   Fill in the pull request template with a description of your changes. Screenshots, testing steps, and any other relevant information are allways welcome.
-   Request a review from one or more of the maintainers or contributors of the project.
-   Address any feedback or comments that you receive on your pull request.
-   Wait for your pull request to be approved and merged by a maintainer.

## Thanks!

Your contributions make this project even better. Thanks for your effort!
